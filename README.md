#Week of 15 Login with Authentication

### Introduction

* You will use `Handlebars` to generate HTML
* You will use `Sequelize` to create data models for the database storage
* You will use `Express` for routing
* You will use `Bootstrap` (or `Materialize`) as a frontend CSS framework
* You will use jQuery for front end form validation

### User story

My Class App. You will be creating a system for the class. It should have user
registration and a user login. There should be a registration page, a login page,
a `students` page, an `instructors` page. Students have one instructor and up to
2 TA's. Instructors have many students. An Instructor can be either a TA or a Teacher.

### Steps

#### User Interface
Design a user interface that is pleasing to the eye. CSS Frameworks are your friend.

#### Sessions
Store the session data in a MySQL Database

#### Data Models
Your data models will change quickly, so you will have to use migrations to keep up.

#### Routing / Templating
There should be a layout that is consistent across all pages. And (roughly speaking),
a template will match with a route.
